## Coursera_ML

This is a Machine Learning online course offered by Stanford University on Coursera.

Topic and things that I learnt includes:
Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
